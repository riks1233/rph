# Time spent (in hours)

**Format: `<number of hours>: <explanation>`**

- 1: Reading, understanding the task, questions.
- 2: Setting up the project based on previous projects and experience. Messing with wampserver - wasn't working.
- 4: Set up an `/all` endpoint and got it working as expected. Was researching PDO statements, fetching, and also messing with PHP arrays (indexed vs associative, unset() wasn't working as I expected with the indexed array).
- 3: Set up other endpoints.
